/**
 * @defgroup buzzer_module Buzzer Module
 * 
 * Created on: Mar 26, 2019
 *    Authors: Nikola Kosaric, Nate Hoffman, Brian Harlow, DJ Stahlberger 
 *
 * The following module utilizes the task manager and timing module
 * in order to inact a buzzer to produce a sound at a determined frequency.
 * The timing module is used to control the frequency of the sound produced
 * and the task module is used to control the length of time the buzzer will 
 * sound.
 *
 * In oder to utilize this module, first, the Buzzer_Init must be called.
 * Then, the Buzzer_Sound function must be called in order to determine the
 * frequency at which the buzzer will sound and the length of time the buzzer
 * will sound. The channel used for the buzzer will be determined in the 
 * hardware abstraction layer.
